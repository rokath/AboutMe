&nbsp; Short&nbsp; travel&nbsp; report&nbsp; Central&nbsp; and&nbsp; South
America<br>
<br>
<br>
 With the train I went within 24 hours to Mexico-City. May be it<br>
was wrong to go that fast, because I saw cactay and horseback<br>
riders with sombreros from my window. The town was not<br>
impressive but in Veracruz I came thru SERVAS in contact with a<br>
very lovely family and I learned original Mexican lifestyle.<br>
Later in Tapachula I spent the holy week at the Pacific and the<br>
people there I will never forget.<br>
<br>
 In Guatemala I spent more than 3 weeks. There are many other<br>
travellers. It is a cheap and interesting place. Beautiful<br>
vulcanos, lakes and rain forests. The indians sell colourful<br>
handmade dresses and the railway is a pure adventure.<br>
<br>
 In San Salvador I saw the biggest and most busy markets during<br>
my travel tour. Electricity is always short and usually the<br>
energy is availiable only after 8 pm. Darkness comes between 6<br>
and 7, so is there every day an hour of silence in the eve. But<br>
than the music boxes start their sounds and happyness comes to<br>
the people.<br>
<br>
 Honduras saw me also only a few days. I stood with a family in<br>
the city and felt sorry not to have the rest for a dshungle<br>
tour. But I really intended to go a bit faster now southwards.<br>
<br>
 The purest and worst country in Central America is Nicaragua.<br>
First did Somoza so bad for the people and after him destroyed<br>
the Sandinistas the leftovers. I visited the only SERVAS host<br>
there. He is an interesting man. He had a good job until the<br>
Sandinistas tryed to get him in their political party. Now he is<br>
living from dirty and hard part time jobs like working in<br>
american ships staying at the harbour.<br>
<br>
 As I reached Costa Rica I could breeze more freely. I do not<br>
know how it works. But I can feel the atmosphere of a place.<br>
This is one of the most relaxing and soft places I have seen.<br>
The only country with no beggars (as far I could see). People<br>
are friendly and helpfully. No one moment of feeling danger,<br>
even late in the night. I was about 2 weeks there.<br>
<br>
 From Panama to Colombia is no road and I had absolutely no<br>
interest in flying because it is expensive and uninteresting. I<br>
was lucky to find a boat, but it was a contraband one. Only<br>
about Panama I could write now a few pages.<br>
<br>
 Colombia is full of contrasts and so worth visiting a few<br>
month. I was in the banana fields, in Medellin, Bogota and the<br>
pampas. In Popayan 4 men tryed to mugg me. We had a short fight<br>
and I had no problems to get rid of them. But later a<br>
motorcyclist stopped and told me about the blood on my back. It<br>
was my luck, that the knive was stopped by the ripps and so I<br>
got only a superficial injury of about one cm deep. And it was<br>
their luck that I did not realize their knive and may be that<br>
was also my luck, because I am ready not to take care for their<br>
lifes in such situation. So all are lucky.<br>
<br>
 In Ecuador again are many other travellers like in Guatemala.<br>
In every country I met other travellers but in theese two small<br>
states are plenty of them. Ecuador is the smallest of the South<br>
American countries but one of the most beautiful ones. I was 5<br>
weeks there. The vulcano Tunguaruha is only one under many<br>
others and 5016m high - for South America nothing special. But I<br>
was never at this altitude and so I decided climbing to the top.<br>
I tasted fruits in the dshungle, visitet Quito and also the<br>
Pacific. The ocean is is very calm there.<br>
<br>
 6 Weeks I spent in Peru together with 3 other travellers from<br>
Switzerland. All the coastline is a huge desert, but when You go<br>
to the mountains You will find some of the most beautiful<br>
landscapes in the world. Ca&curren;on de Colca was the name of a place<br>
where You can look more than 1000m deep down into a marvelous<br>
valley and condors are flying around Your head.<br>
<br>
 And it was in Bolivia where I decided to go home. I checked out<br>
all companies and found the russian Aeroflot to be the cheapest.<br>
790 US$ from Buenos Aires to Berlin over Moscow. I got an<br>
invitation from my friends there and got this way very easy a<br>
visa for Russia. I did a bit tracking in mountains and rain<br>
forests, met interesting people and visited a tin mine where<br>
indians are still working under the conditions of former<br>
centuries.<br>
<br>
 Through Argentinia I hitch hiked relatively fast. It is a<br>
beautiful country, but expensive like Europe. I could imagine to<br>
spend a whole holliday only in this state. They like meat and<br>
wine most and indeed it is a mess to participate in a typical<br>
lunch or dinner.<br>
<br>
 In the end of November I took of from South America and a day<br>
later the airplain landed savty in Moscow. In Buenos Aires was<br>
summer and the temperature in the russian city was -20&oslash;C. But my<br>
friends came with a thick coat and a warm car to the airport.<br>
<br>
 The five weeks I spent in Moscow where very beautiful for me.<br>
Now I am home again and have no further plans to travel. I will<br>
try to write down some notices about my tour, and show slides to<br>
my friends.<br>
